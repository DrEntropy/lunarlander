## Learning excercise in policy gradients

* lunar_lander.ipynb implements a very simple policy gradient algorithm to solve the lunar lander problem from OpenAI gym using pyTorch

* It loosly based on code from [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781098125967/) by Aurélien Géron. 

* I did not make any serious attempts at hyperparameter tuning. It is still pretty cool that it can basically get the lander on the pad. Mostly. :)
